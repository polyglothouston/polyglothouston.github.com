            <p>
                We are a group of programmers who get together a few times a
                month to learn, teach, listen, and work on a wide range of
                programming projects.  There are no rules except to show up
                with the enthusiasm to learn, willingness to teach, and courage
                to show off your ideas.
            </p>
            <h2>Where/When</h2>
            <p>
                We currently try meet every other Thursday at 6:30 PM.  We are
                exploring different locations for meetings.  Currently we meet
                at <a href="http://www.stagsheadpub.com">The Stag's Head</a>,
                which is a great pub featuring decent wifi, good beers, and
                solid pub cuisine.
